									<h1 class="major">Hello, my name<br />
									is Laura Lasso</h1>
									<p>I am a graduate in <strong>data science and engineering</strong> at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. For four years, I have been acquiring a fluency in terms of data management and everything that goes with it. In addition, thanks to the internships given, I have been able to familiarize myself with the workplace and have acquired basic and necessary skills, such as knowing how to work in a team.</p>

									<h2 class="major">My hobbies</h2>
									<p>Throughout my life, both mathematics and computer science have always attracted me. Although I have not always been good at math, in high school everything changed completely. I began to take them as a challenge, not as something I had to pass. As for computer science, I have always liked programming since I started in this field. Outside the student sphere, I have always considered that having time for oneself is essential. For me, that moment is the gym.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Volunteering</h2>
									<p>For a year, I was a volunteer for the ADA association in a shelter where you could find all kinds of animals, from dogs and cats to rabbits and chickens. Our main function was to clean the cages where the dogs and cats were kept, feed them and walk the dogs. Although this took his effort, since each animal, especially dogs, is a world, he was rewarded seeing how they all gradually overcome the problems with which they entered thanks to our help.</p>
